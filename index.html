        <p>Henonicks, me, is a <span class = "ua-color">Ukrainian</span> guy. I'm making a project for fun.
        <br> it's Guiding Light. This website is a part of it and wouldn't been made if not the bot. I'm learning HTML and CSS and
            this website is my practice and first experience.
        <br>I somewhat know C++ and am starting the HTML + CSS journey. Maybe I will learn JavaScript to improve this site (this still didn't happen <img class = "emoji" src = "https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1123637538469466247.webp">).
        <br>The bot for which I made this is written with D++. There are many people who have contributed to it at some point.
        <br> For example, a couple of nice people and I wrote some of the examples in the documentation, while others wrote code for the library. Some did both.
        <br> I really like it, and its community who can help you out when stuck. I also help others with their struggles.
        <br> If you are lookng for a Discord API C++ library, I'd recommend D++. <img class = "emoji" src = "https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1123637538469466247.webp">

        <p>Guiding Light is the reason this website exists. It's a Discord bot that manages JTC (Join-To-Create) voice channels.
            <br>To make it work, set up a notification and JTC channels. When someone joins a JTC, a temporary channel is created.
            <br>It will also notify your members when this happens and will tell when it's deleted.
            <br> The bot is written in C++, using the <a href = "github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP"><img class = "emoji" src = "https://dpp.dev/DPP-Logo.png" alt = "D++"> library</a>.
