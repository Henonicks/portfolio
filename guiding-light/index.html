        <h2>Introduction (about)</h2>
        <p>Guiding Light is a very original <img src = "https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1166481699086012456.webp" class = "emoji">
            Discord bot. Its purpose is to manage JTC (Join-To-Create) voice channels.
            <br>This means that when you connect to one a temporary is created and you are moved to it. It also has an exclusive feature:
            <br>notification channels. When a temporary channel is created for someone, a message about it is sent to a notification channel.
            <br>Another feature is the <span class = "code-font">/type</span> command. It allows anyone who joined our 
                <a href = "https://discord.gg/N9FXfEZwcB">community guild</a> to send a message from the bot.
            <br>It's not that useful but you can send animated and some of the external emoji thanks to this!
            <div class = "warning" style = "height: 90px;">
                <span class = "w-text">NOTE:</span>
                Users cannot use emoji of unknown guilds. This means that if the emoji you want to use is in guild A while the bot isn't, instead
                of emoji you'll see part of its representation, e. g. <span class = "code-font">:emoji_name:</span>
